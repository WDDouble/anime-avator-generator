# Anime Avatar Generator

An anime avatar generator based on web scraping, OpenCV, and PROGAN.

## Project Architecture

1. Web scraper: Scraping anime images using Scrapy.
2. Image preprocessing: Extracting and evaluating anime avatar using OpenCV.
3. GAN model: Implementing a PROGAN model with PyTorch for generating anime avatars.
4. Web application: Building a web application with Flask to integrate the GAN model.

## Features

- Scrape high-quality anime images.
- Extract anime avatars using OpenCV.
- Train a GAN model to generate anime avatars.
- Web application that allows users to generate anime avatars.
